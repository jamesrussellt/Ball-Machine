# Prototype CAD

A prototype of the `Selection Sort comparator` was made for demonstrating its design using larger 40mm balls.

Adaptations to the original design include:
 * A new `Star Piece` used in the `Timing Gate` assembly
 * A new `Reset Lever` used for holding and releasing the shaft used to separate the heaviest ball
 * A new `Ramp System` used for separating the heaviest ball from the rest

`Star Piece`
PIC OF OLD AND NEW
 * Faces added to each point of star to prevent other lever slipping over it.

`Reset Lever`
PIC OF OLD AND NEW
 * Counter weight and stopper added to allow the lever to move into position faster when catching the shaft.

`Ramp System`
PIC OF OLD AND NEW
 * Old ramp system was proven by calculation and testing to not rely on ball weight whatsoever. This design only works for balls of various surface roughnesses which may hinder starting speeds.
 * New ramp system has been calculated to require 3 rotating ramps of 150mm length each per ball lane. This design will require further prototyping to prove its concept.
