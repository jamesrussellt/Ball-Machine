# Prototype CAD

A prototype of the `Selection Sort comparator` was made for demonstrating its design using larger 40mm balls.

Adaptations to the original design include:
 * A new `Star Piece` used in the `Timing Gate` assembly
 * A new `Reset Lever` used for holding and releasing the shaft used to separate the heaviest ball
 * A new `Ramp System` used for separating the heaviest ball from the rest

 * Faces added to each point of star to prevent other lever slipping over it.

 * Counter weight and stopper added to allow the lever to move into position faster when catching the shaft.
 * Please note lever was damaged in picture shown. Actual lever would not require glue to rest on shaft.

`Ramp System`
 * Old ramp system was proven by calculation and testing to not rely on ball weight but on ramp angle and friction. This design only works for balls of various surface roughnesses which may hinder starting speeds.
 * New ramp design required using individual rotating ramps per ball lane.
 * New ramp design has been calculated to require 3 rotating ramps of 150mm length each per ball lane.
 * This design will require further prototyping to prove its concept.
