Contains models and drawings of balls to be used in machine.

Balls are made from steel ball bearings of various sizes incased in a 3D printed ABS plastic casing to ensure they all have the same outer diameter and surface roughness. The ball bearings are the main contributor in the weight difference between balls as steel has a high density of around 7700kg/m3.

The balls are manufactured from different coloured ABS plastic in the colours of the rainbow, i.e. red = heaviest ball -> blue = lightest ball. This allows people to see the balls sorted rather than having to compare weight differences by hand.
