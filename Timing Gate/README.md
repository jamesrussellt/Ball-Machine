# Timing Gate

![logo](https://github.com/jamesrussellt/Ball-Machine/blob/master/Images/Timing_Assy.png)

Used within `Selection Sort` comparator and adapated for the `Pancake Sort` comparator to release all balls at the same time once each ball arrives at the gate.

Each ball lifts the boomerange-shaped lever upon arrival which can rotate independantly on its shaft. Once all these levers are lifted, the star-shaped pieces, which are connected to the shaft so must rotate together, are free to rotate and the balls drop at the same time.
