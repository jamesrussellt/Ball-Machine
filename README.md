## About this repository
As part of IMAGINARY open mathematics exhibitions (https://imaginary.org/), this machine demonstrates the use of Selection Sorting and Pancake Sorting Algorithms using balls of different weights.

## Manufacturing This Machine
Please see `BOM.xlsx` for full list of sub assemblies and parts required for this machine build.

## Instructions 
See each folder for more detail.

## More info
Another comparing mechanism, designed by Evgeniy Shiryaev, can be used for sorting algorithms which require 2 balls to be compared at a time. This comparator was used as a starting point for the project and lead to the development of Selection and Pancake comparators which compare all balls at once.
