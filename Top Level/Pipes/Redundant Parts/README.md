## About this repository
As part of IMAGINARY open mathematics exhibitions (https://imaginary.org/), this machine demonstrates the use of Selection Sorting and Pancake Sorting Algorithms using balls of different weights.

## Contents

* `Balls`
  * Balls of various weights to be used in machine.
  * Folder contains CAD models and manufacturing drawings.
* `Pancake Sort`
  * 
* `Selection Sort`
  * 
* `Timing Gate`
  * 
* `Top Level`
  * 

The following folders were used for the creation of the machine and serve no purpose for manufacturing.

* `2018_Templates` 
  * Manufacturing drawing templates used when creating machine assembly and component drawings.
* `Images`
  * Images used for open source documentation.
* `Man`
  * CAD model of human used to present machine size.
* `OldVersions`
  * A backup of old overwritten files automatically saved when using Autodesk Inventor Software.
* `Prototype CAD`
  * A copy of the 'Selection Sort comparator' used to prove design principles.
  * Is built for larger 40mm balls and may contain other components for design adaptation.

## Manufacturing This Machine
Please see `BOM.xlsx` for full list of sub assemblies and parts required for this machine build.

## Instructions 
See each folder for more detail.

## More info
Another comparing mechanism, designed by Evgeniy Shiryaev, can be used for sorting algorithms which require 2 balls to be compared at a time. This comparator was used as a starting point for the project and lead to the development of Selection and Pancake comparators which compare all balls at once.
